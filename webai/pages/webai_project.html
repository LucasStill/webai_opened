            Currently in my last semester at Maastricht University, I am working on my final thesis towards graduation. It consists of sharing data of users visiting your website to extract key features, and train autonomous agents combined with language models fine-tuned for the web. Metrics such as genders, emotions, and psychological aspects can be predicted giving a new web data framework to work with. You can help me with this by adding the script below to the pages of your website.

        <!--             Extract interaction data of users visiting your site such as mouse movements, touches, page layout information, and more. Then build a model able to tell a user's gender, emotional profile and other metrics. Combined with this, a fine-tuned language model will be created in order to understand HTML content allowing an AI to explore the web by itself. You can help me gather data by adding the script below to your site's pages in a transparent manner. -->

        The webAI script records a user’s interactions with the page they are navigating into: mouse movements, touches, clicks and scrolls. These packets are sent each second to a server which will then crawl the page that has been explored. This data allows us to develop a model on various configurations of the collected page to train and explore it by itself.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>In 2021 was presented an initial version of a project titled WebAI. The goal was to analyze whether profiles consisting of gender, emotions or age could be predicted from mouse data movements. A test site was created based on research from <a style="color: #0080ff" href="https://www.academia.edu/35136540/Reading_Emotion_From_Mouse_Cursor_Motions_Affective_Computing_Approach" target="_blank">Yamauchi & Xiao</a> which created sub experiments in order to provoke emotional or test contextual behaviors. The design of the site was fully thought to trigger those behaviors, but comes with the limitation that most sites are not designed that way and hindered its potential for generalization to other environments.</p>
        <p>Additionally, recent improvements in large language models such as <a style="color: #0080ff" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03945" target="_blank">‘Understanding HTML with Large Language Models’</a> by Gur et all offer possibilities to train such agents in understanding the content it is faced with. In 2016, OpenAI released <a style="color: #0080ff;" href="https://openai.com/blog/universe/" target="_blank">Universe</a> with the purpose of developing a general purpose agent to play video games and use interfaces. One of its limiting factors was to use video data, which is not the best choice regarding web content. In the scope of this project, we are aiming at using HTML content directly as combined with stylesheets and scripts, contains all the information of the environment. We aim at combining both user’s interaction data on real-world websites with a language model fine-tuned for the web to create autonomous agents.

        <h2>Several questions are attempted to be answered in the scope of this project</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="step_container" style="display: block;">
        <div class="step">
            <p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;">1. What are the most effective machine learning techniques for analyzing mouse data to navigate the web? </span> As most of the data will be time series data from the cursor, deep learning is a favored choice. But possibly algorithms for tabular data such as XGBoost can be used by extracting key metrics from the data, or use several sub-algorithms and voting mechanisms according to what type of action is being done like scrolling, reading, and feed that into smaller SVM models. Training and comparing several such models and highlighting the results will allow us to rank their effectiveness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;">2. How well can an AI trained on mouse data collected from real websites navigate and interact with different types of websites? </span> If an AI can be trained to mimic human behavior and complete some tasks on collected web pages, we need to test whether it can do the same on new unseen pages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;">3. How can we evaluate the performance of an AI trained on web navigation data? </span> Several performance metrics need to be defined in order to evaluate such an AI, such as the precision of the navigation, identifying elements on the page, or mimicking human behaviors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;">4. What are the ethical implications of using mouse data collected from real websites to train an AI for web navigation? </span> Such technology raises questions about online identity, as in this case AIs passing as humans and mimicking their behaviors and interactions can be problematic. These aspects will be arguments towards ethical considerations in this work. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;">5. How can mouse data collected from real websites be used to predict user profiles? </span> direct navigation data from a real in-situ environment (as not being aware of the experiment), questionnaire to collect personal information about a person, and analysis of their exploration allow to find key metrics linked to certain behaviors and profiles.

        <h2>More than training Autonomous Agents.</h2>
        <p>
            The resulting dataset from the collection would allow to set up a framework for additional works in users’ behavior such as extracting key properties in the data, and eventually propose new routines in the design of landing pages.

    <div class="section">
        <h2 style="color: #f2f2f2">How it works</h2>
        <p>The current phase of this project is to collect data. For that we need to extract interactions users are performing on the web, and you can help by adding the script above on your site. It works this way:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step_container">
        <div class="step">
            <p>1. Users explore your site normally, each second their mouse movements, clicks and scrolls are sent as packets to a secured server.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <p>2. When collected, the origin page is crawled to extract key metrics from the interaction with the content: specific sections, shapes, colors, all contextualizing the actions performed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <p>3. After three pages of your site visited, a pop-up invites your visitor to take part in a survey. This allows to map certain profiles with the extracted metrics, and label part of the data.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="section" style="color: #f2f2f2">
        This process allows linking usage of web-content to a psychological state experienced by the user. Also, we can study these interactions at content-specific levels which could provide insights into improving KPI performances and better design routines for developers.

        <h2>I know you care about Transparency, I do too. Let's open-source.</h2>
        <p class="sub_explanation">Currently, this is part of a research thesis to conclude a master degree in Artificial Intelligence at the Department of Advanced Computing Sciences at Maastricht University. This work is not used to provide a paid service or generate any form of profit as it is a student's project. It is important to emphasize that this data is not kept private. Thus, continuous improvements to open-source the database and the code for those willing to help are under way.</p>
