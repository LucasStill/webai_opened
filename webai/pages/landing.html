            Currently in my last semester at Maastricht University, I am working on my final thesis towards graduation. It consists of sharing data of users visiting your website to extract key features, and train autonomous agents combined with language models fine-tuned for the web. Metrics such as genders, emotions, and psychological aspects can be predicted giving a new web data framework to work with. You can help me with this by adding the script below to the pages of your website.
        </p>

        <!--             Extract interaction data of users visiting your site such as mouse movements, touches, page layout information, and more. Then build a model able to tell a user's gender, emotional profile and other metrics. Combined with this, a fine-tuned language model will be created in order to understand HTML content allowing an AI to explore the web by itself. You can help me gather data by adding the script below to your site's pages in a transparent manner. -->

        <h2 style="color: #f2f2f2">How it works</h2>
        <p>The current phase of this project is to collect data. For that we need to extract interactions users are performing on the web, and you can help by adding the script above on your site. It works this way:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step_container">
        <div class="step">
            <p>1. Users explore your site normally, each second their mouse movements, clicks and scrolls are sent as packets to my server.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <p>2. When collected, the origin page is crawled to extract key metrics from the interaction with the content: specific sections, shapes, colors, all contextualizing the actions performed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <p>3. After three pages of your site visited, a pop-up invites your visitor to take part in a survey. This allows to map certain profiles with the extracted metrics, and label part of the data.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="section" style="color: #f2f2f2">
        This process allows linking usage of web-content to a psychological state experienced by the user. Also, we can study these interactions at content-specific levels which could provide insights into improving KPI performances and better design routines for developers.
    </p>
</div>




<div class="container">
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Many goals such as personalized and relevant content.</h2>
        <p class="sub_explanation">This project has many goals. One of them could be to improve a user's experience by providing more personalized and relevant content. By collecting user interactions and predicting user profiles, the AI could tailor the content and recommendations it presents to individual users. This can lead to a more enjoyable and satisfying experience for users, as they are presented with content that is more relevant to their interests and needs. Additionally, the AI may be able to anticipate user needs and proactively present relevant information, further enhancing the user experience.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!--
<div class="container">
    <div class="section">
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p class="sub_explanation">We collect various interaction data from your visitors through data packets sent each second. These include mouse, touches, scrolls, clicks and page properties such as the dimensions of the page. After a certain amount of time we open a pop-up which invites the user to answer a couple of questions.</p>
        <p class="sub_explanation">At the same time, WebAI's server backend will crawl the opened page and extract key metrics from the interaction data. This information is crossed with previous existing research helping to identify key patterns to understand a user's profile and its navigation objectives. We aim at improving this by focusing solely on web content information and by applying different machine learning techniques.</p>
        <p class="sub_explanation">Furthermore, one of the objective is to combine this with a fine-tuned language model trained on html language to evaluate whether such an agent could explore the web by itself as shown in previous papers.</p>
        <p class="sub_explanation">All I would need is for you to add the script above on your website. You can look through it to see how it works, or feel free to reach out for me to explain it personally with you.</p>

        <h2>Protecting user privacy by eliminating the need for invasive cookie tracking.</h2>
        <p class="sub_explanation">Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on a user's device and used to track their online behavior. While cookies can be useful for certain purposes, such as remembering user preferences or providing targeted advertising, they can also be a privacy concern as they can be used to track a user's activities across different websites and build up a detailed profile of their interests and habits. By collecting user interactions and predicting user profiles through other means, this research project aims to eliminate the need for cookies and protect user privacy.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Advance the field of artificial intelligence by training AI's to navigate the web using only web elements.</h2>
        <p class="sub_explanation">Currently, AI's are often trained using large datasets, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive to create and maintain. By collecting user interactions and predicting user profiles from web elements alone, the AI research project aims to develop a new method of training AI's that is more efficient and scalable by working with client-users. This could open up new possibilities for AI applications and potentially lead to the development of more advanced AI systems in the future.</p>

<div class="container">
    <div class="section">
        <h2>I know you care about Transparency, I do too. Let's open-source.</h2>
        <p class="sub_explanation">By making the project open, we can share the findings and insights with the broader community, allowing others to build upon their work and contribute to the advancement of artificial intelligence. Additionally, by operating on a non-profit basis, the research project can focus on its goals and objectives rather than being driven by financial incentives. This can help to ensure that the project is driven by a desire to benefit the community and advance knowledge, rather than by profit-driven considerations.</p>
        <p class="sub_explanation">Currently, this is part of my research thesis to conclude my master degree in Artificial Intelligence at the Department of Advanced Computing Sciences at Maastricht University. This work is not used to provide a paid service or generate any form of profit as it is a student's project. Honestly, it is important that I emphasize that this data is not kept private. Thus, I'll add continuous improvements to open-source the database and the code for those who help me.</p>
        <p class="sub_explanation">If you help to contribute to this project, I'll share in advance all progress with you and share my findings. I'd love if you would reach out too so we can get on this together! I believe that such projects must be open, and I want to set it that way.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Contribute to the broader community by sharing findings and insights with the public.</h2>
        <p class="sub_explanation">Additionally, the project can share its findings with the general public, providing education and raising awareness about the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence. This can help to foster a greater understanding and appreciation of the technology, as well as its potential applications and implications.</p>
